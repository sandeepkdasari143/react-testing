## Test Driven Development (TDD)::
Test driven development is a software development process where you write tests before writing the software code.

Once the tests have been written, you then write the code to ensure the test pass...

- Create tests that verify the functionality of a specific feature.
- Write Software code that will run the tests successfully when re-executed.
- Refactor the code for optimization while ensuring the test continue pass.

Also called **red-green** testing as all the tests go from a red failed state to a green passed state.
